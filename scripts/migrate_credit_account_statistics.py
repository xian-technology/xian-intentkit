"""
Migration script to populate new statistics fields in credit_accounts table.

This script calculates and populates the following fields based on transaction history:
- total_income, total_free_income, total_reward_income, total_permanent_income
- total_expense, total_free_expense, total_reward_expense, total_permanent_expense

The script locks three tables (credit_accounts, credit_transactions, credit_events)
for each record to prevent interference from running programs.
