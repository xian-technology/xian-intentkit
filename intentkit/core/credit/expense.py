# =============================================================================
# PAYMENT FLOW OVERVIEW
# =============================================================================
#
# The three main expense functions below (expense_message, expense_skill,
# expense_summarize) share ~80% identical structure. This is INTENTIONAL.
#
# Why the duplication exists and why it should NOT be refactored:
#
# 1. CLARITY OVER ABSTRACTION: Payment/billing code is among the most
#    audited and debugged code in any system. Each function represents a
#    distinct billing event type (message, skill call, memory/summarize)
#    with its own event type, upstream transaction IDs, destination
#    accounts, and transaction types. Abstracting the shared logic into
#    a helper would obscure the full payment flow when reading any single
#    function, making auditing and debugging harder.
#
# 2. INDEPENDENT EVOLUTION: Each expense type may diverge over time
#    (e.g. skill expenses already have a separate skill_cost() pre-check,
#    message expenses track hourly budget). Keeping them separate means
#    changes to one billing path never accidentally affect another.
#
# 3. FINANCIAL SAFETY: In payment code, an easy-to-follow linear flow
#    is worth more than DRY. Every function tells the complete story from
#    validation to final transaction records without jumping to helpers.
#
# SHARED PAYMENT FLOW (common to all three functions):
#   Step 0: Idempotency check — reject duplicate upstream transaction IDs
#   Step 1: Validate & quantize the base amount (LLM cost or skill price)
#   Step 2: Compute fees — discount, platform fee %, agent fee %
#   Step 3: Deduct total from team's credit account (or get/create if $0)
#   Step 4: Track free credit usage against agent's daily quota
#   Step 5: Split the deducted amount by credit type (free/reward/permanent)
#   Step 6: Proportionally allocate platform & agent fees across credit types
#   Step 7: Derive base amounts per credit type via subtraction
#   Step 8: Credit the destination accounts (message/skill/memory + platform fee + agent fee)
#   Step 9: Create the CreditEvent record with full breakdown
#   Step 10: Create CreditTransaction records (one debit + N credits)
#
# DIFFERENCES between the three functions:
#   - expense_message: EventType.MESSAGE, destination = PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_MESSAGE,
#     tracks hourly LLM budget via accumulate_hourly_base_llm_amount
#   - expense_skill: EventType.SKILL_CALL, destination = PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_SKILL,
#     uses skill_cost() for pre-calculation, upstream_tx_id includes skill_call_id
#   - expense_summarize: EventType.MEMORY, destination = PLATFORM_ACCOUNT_MEMORY,
#     similar to message but billed to the memory account
